            Invest not in money and not in us, rather in the excess food in your house, your catering service, your restaurant and all the weddings.Using our user friendly website, you can donate this food to Entree, and we will collect it from you to distribute in the village nearby. All you need to do is log in or sign in so that your data is retained in the database, and your donations can be reviewed by you.

            As more people than ever are in need of food, we act as the bridge between the 2 problems of food shortage and food wastage. Additionally, this also reduces global warming by decreasing the carbon dioxide emissions.We urge other organisations to invest in us too, through which the additional food which remains undelivered can be utilised too. Perks are also given to the highest doner, as shown by the leaderboard.
